</a>

You can also install it through the AUR if you use Arch Linux:
[extension-manager](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/extension-manager), [extension-manager-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/extension-manager-git)

## Translations
Extension Manager has been translated into several different languages. Ideally, the
program will respect your system language out-of-the-box. However, you may need to take
some additional steps in order for flatpak to recognise your chosen locale. The
following workaround may work for you:

Set the languages you wish to use explicitly (e.g. `en` for English, `es` for Espa√±ol):
```
# Optionally add --user if installed in a user prefix
flatpak config --set languages 'en;es'
```

Then update:
```
flatpak update
```

Now Extension Manager should respect your system language.

## Building
The easiest way to build is by cloning this repo with GNOME Builder. It
will automatically resolve all relevant flatpak SDKs automatically.

If you run into issues, make sure you have the [`gnome-nightly`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Nightly)
flatpak repository installed.
